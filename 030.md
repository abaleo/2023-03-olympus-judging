# claimRewards() will never claim rewards

## Summary

Function claimRewards() will never claim rewards for the vault as it doesn't use the right parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail

auraRewardPool().getReward in claimRewards uses the owner as account to check rewards for instead of the vault.
Thus this will never claim rewards for the vault.

Rewards can still be claimed by inputing claim = true when calling withdraw.

## Impact

- UX impact and gas cost increase as the user can't harvest rewards without calling withdraw.
- Useless claimRewards function in the code

## Code Snippet

Vault
https://github.com/0xLienid/sherlock-olympus/blob/e502fe566516f358141118a40f1c02e014f8b27c/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L262-L269

AuraRewardPool

It is linked on the doc : https://docs.aura.finance/developers/building-on-aura and seems to be the baseRewardPool used in production (ex: https://etherscan.io/address/0xe4683fe8f53da14ca5dac4251eadfb3aa614d528).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change owner() with address(this) or call getRewards() that uses msg.sender instead.

```solidity
 auraRewardPool().getReward(address(this), true);

// or

 auraRewardPool().getReward();
```
