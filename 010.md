# The remaining LP is not returned to the user

## Summary

The remaining LP in the `BLVaultLido` contract is not returned to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
// // https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L177-L180
            // Stake into Aura
            liquidityPool.approve(address(auraBooster), lpAmountOut);
            bool depositSuccess = auraBooster.deposit(pid(), lpAmountOut, true);
            if (!depositSuccess) revert BLVaultLido_AuraDepositFailed();
```

The LPs deposit to auraBooster may be less than `lpAmountOut`, resulting in the possibility of remaining LP in the contract.

## Impact

The user's LP may thus be lost in this contract.
