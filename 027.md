# System could be gamed by single-sided depositing through the vault with an added preliminary step

## Summary
The system can be gamed by first shifting more of the LP into OHM, then only depositing through the vault, performing a large swap (either via user balance, a large loan, or a flash loan) to shift more of the LP into wstETH, then exiting the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a typical scenario, assuming the pool has been initiated with total LP equal to sqrt(100_000 * 1_000) = 10_000. (Note: OHM: $15, wstETH: $1500 with the pool pricing match up with [manager.getOhmTknPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L156) or [manager.getTknOhmPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L232), i.e. 100 OHM to 1 wstETH or 0.01 wstETH to 1 OHM. The pool token balances in each step below may be calculated via the [Constant Product Simulation](https://amm-calculator.vercel.app/) after each swap and stake.)

    OHM token balance: 100_000
    wstETH token balance: 1_000
    Total LP: 10_000

1. The user will first swap 10000 OHM for 90.91 wstETH making an initial loss of 10000 * 15 - 90.91 * 1500 = $13635 on paper.

    OHM token balance: 110_000
    wstETH token balance: 909.09
    Total LP: 10_000

2. A [single-sided deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L143) through the vault is made with 110 wstETH so that 11000 OHM is minted and 110 - 909.09 * 0.1 = 19.09 wstETH is [unused and refunded](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L192-L194). (Note: The user successfully stakes with 11000 OHM and 90.91 wstETH and proportionately receives 1000 LP.)

    OHM token balance: 121_000
    wstETH token balance: 1000    
    Total LP: 11_000
    User's LP: 1_000

3. The user swaps 100 wstETH for 11000 OHM and makes a profit of 11000 * 15 - 100 * 1500 = $15000 on paper. After offsetting the earlier paper loss, the net profit for the swaps is 15000 - 13635 = $1365.

    OHM token balance: 110_000
    wstETH token balance: 1_100    
    Total LP: 11_000
    User's LP: 1_000

4. Next, the user's LP is fully [withdrawn](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L203) where 10000 OHM is received and [burned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L244) while 100 wstETH is fully [transferred](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L247) to the user because the pool wstETH  per 1 OHM pricing is back to equaling [getTknOhmPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L232), i.e. `wstethAmountOut == expectedWstethAmountOut` making [`wstethToReturn == wstethAmountOut`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L236-L240).

    OHM token balance: 100_000
    wstETH token balance: 1_000    
    Total LP: 10_000
    User's LP: 0

## Impact
The user makes 100 - 90.91 = 9.09 wstETH. Together with the swap profit, the total gross arbitrage is 9.09 * 1500 + 1365 = $15000, which is way more than enough to cover for all needed flash loan and transaction fees.  

In fact, steps 1 - 4 arbitrage exploit could be repeated since the pool is now rebalanced to match up with the market pricing again.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a snapshot of the entry record of OHM and wstETH and compare that with the proportionate exit record. Check if the pool has been twice imbalanced in opposite manner between the two snapshots. If it has been, slash the differential for treasury dissuading large attempts to shift the pool around with the preliminary step aforesaid in step 1 added to the know and fixed issue, steps 2 to 4.
