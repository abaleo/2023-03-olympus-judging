# Value of OHM minted can be extracted with profit by an attacker

## Summary
The value of ohm minted during deposit can be extracted by an attacker by adding and then remoiving liquidity from the undelying pool along with some swaps for price manipulation in the underlying pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Price of WstETH = 200 OHM, initially there is 100 wstETH + 20_000 OHM on the OHM/wstETH balancer pool
2. Flashloan 27032 wstETH
3. Swap WETH for OHM on the market: 5000 WETH for 1000000 OHM
4. Add Liquidity to OHM/WstETH pool: 400_000 OHM + 2000 ETH, gets 2000 BPT
5. Swap WstETH for OHM on the underlying pool: 10000 wstETH for 347000 OHM
6. Deposit on the vault: Deposit 10000 wstETH, the vault will add 4_000_000 OHM, vault gets 1735 BPT
7. Swap OHM for WstETH on the Underlying pool: 943940 OHM for 6964 swtETH
8. Withdraw all from the vault: gets 8286 wstETH
9. Remove liquidity from the underlying OHM/WstETH pool: get 7891 wstETH + 1578200 OHM
10. Net gain in wstETH = 2562 wstETH

The repo did not have any forking tests so the coded PoC was quite long to write and did not have enough time. For this, the calculations in the steps above could be approximative.

## Impact
Attacker can extract a large amount of value from the OHM minting capability of the vault with profit

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rethink the economic design of withdrawal/ deposit / minting of OHM.
