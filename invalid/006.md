# Lack of emergency exit mechanism in `BLVaultLido`

## Summary
Lack of an emergency exit could lead to users assets trapped in the vault. In the event of the vault becoming inactive, by decision of admin or because there is a critical issue, users would be unable to withdraw their assets, posing a significant risk to the safety and security of their investments.


## Vulnerability Detail
`BLVaultLido` is currently designed without an emergency exit mechanism, which is essential for the safe and secure withdrawal of assets in the case of unexpected system failures, maintenance, or other issues that render the vault inactive. This oversight can lead to user assets being locked within the vault indefinitely, causing significant distress and financial loss to the users.


## Impact
The lack of an emergency exit in the vault system can have severe consequences, including:

1. Loss of user trust in the platform, leading to reduced adoption and potential loss of clients.
2. Financial loss for users who are unable to access their assets.
3. Legal implications for the platform due to potential claims and lawsuits from affected users.
4. Reputational damage to the platform, impacting its competitive position in the market.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L203-L207
`withdraw` function works only `onlyWhileActive` so if vault is inactive will be impossible to users to withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a `emergencyWithdraw` function so a user can withdraw their assets (without rewards) even if the vault is paused.
