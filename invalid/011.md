# Risk due to 100% maximum fee in `BLVaultManagerLido`

## Summary
In the BLVaultManagerLido contract where the maximum fee is set to 100%. This may allow the contract owner to rug pull by setting the fee to 100%.

## Vulnerability Detail
The setFee function in the BLVaultManagerLido contract allows the contract owner to set the fee value as long as it does not exceed MAX_FEE, which is currently set to `10_000`, equivalent to 100%. This could potentially allow the contract owner to rug pull by setting a fee of 100%.

## Impact
If the contract owner sets the fee to 100%, it would mean that users would lose their rewards when interacting with the contract, as the entire rewards amount would be taken as a fee.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to lower the maximum fee to a reasonable value that would prevent rug pulls while still allowing the platform to charge fees for its services. Consider setting the MAX_FEE to a value that is deemed fair and reasonable by the community or implement a governance mechanism to determine the maximum fee.

Alternatively, you could implement a governance mechanism to allow the community or token holders to vote on the maximum fee value, ensuring a fair and transparent fee structure.
