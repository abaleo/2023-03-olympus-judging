# All remaining OHM are burned causing users to lose part of OHM

## Summary

The remaining OHM in the `BLVaultLido` contract should be returned to the user

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L187-L194
        if (unusedOhm > 0) {
            ohm.increaseAllowance(MINTR(), unusedOhm);
            manager.burnOhmFromVault(unusedOhm);
        }

        if (unusedWsteth > 0) {
            wsteth.safeTransfer(msg.sender, unusedWsteth);
        }
```

When the user Deposits, the remaining OHM will be burned and the remaining wstETH will be returned to the user.In some cases, the remaining OHM may be what the user deserves. For example, wstETH has been used up, but there is some remaining OHM in the process of processing. If this part of OHM is burned, the user will lose something (the user should have deserved it).

## Impact

Users may lose some OHM.
