# VautOwners will lose wsteth after a partial withdrawal

## Summary

Users are able to supply wsteth tokens to the vault are able to freely deposit or withdraw from the vault whilst also claiming rewards in the process. Should the vault owner make a partial withdrawal, the transaction will be reverted and the user wont be able to retrieve their funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

This function reverts because on withdrawal the vault will obtain the `uint256 ohmAmountOut = ohm.balanceOf(address(this)) - ohmBefore;` where the balance will be zero during the second withdrawal. The `increaseAllowance()` function will not accept a zero value and will therefore revert. The proof of concept below outlines this scenario:

```solidity
function testCannotClaimPartial() public {

    ERC20 balReward = ERC20(address(aliceVault.bal()));

    vm.startPrank(address(alice));
    wsteth.approve(address(aliceVault), wsteth.balanceOf(address(alice)));
    aliceVault.deposit(100 ether, 0);

    uint256[] memory minTokenAmounts = new uint256[](1);
    minTokenAmounts[0] = 0 ether;

    aliceVault.withdraw(1 ether, minTokenAmounts, true);

    vm.expectRevert();
    aliceVault.withdraw(99 ether, minTokenAmounts, false); // <-- reverts here: Lost funds
    vm.stopPrank();

}
```

## Impact

This will cause a Dos of the `withdraw()` function resulting in the loss of wstETH tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Itâ€™s recommended that instead of withdrawing against the ohm balance of the vault, that instead the vault calculates the ratio of ohm and the `LpAmount` passed as a parameter which is ultimately passed to `increaseAllowance()`.
