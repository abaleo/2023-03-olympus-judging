# SetLimit does not take into account burned OHM

## Summary

The function `setLimit()` may not be able to sufficiently restrict mint ability of manager.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `setLimit()` function reverts when `newLimit_ < deployedOhm`, mintOhmToVault will revert if `deployedOhm + amount_ > ohmLimit + circulatingOhmBurned`. If the value of `circulatingOhmBurned` is high, and the admin can only set the limit above `deployedOhm`, they could end up in a state where they cannot limit the amount the vault is allowed to burn sufficiently. I.e. the vault is always able to mint at least `circulatingOhmBurned` new tokens.

Note that `circulatingOhmBurned` is never lowered (even when minting new tokens), so this value could grow arbitrarily high.

## Impact

Lack of control of admin on mint ability of manager.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use similar restrictions as in `mintOhmToVault()` for `setLimit` or lower `circulatingOhmBurned` when minting new OHM.
