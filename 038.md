# `AURA` reward amount returned may be inaccurate

## Summary
The AURA reward amount claimable and reward rate calculations may be inaccurate because of 2 reasons:
1) The `AuraMining` library to be used is explicitly stated to not be used on-chain because it doesn't account for inflationary tokens minted by the AURA minter
2) It doesn't account for the reward multiplier in the `AuraBooster`.

## Vulnerability Detail
 I assume the `AuraMining` library to be used is [`0x744Be650cea753de1e69BF6BAd3c98490A855f52`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x744Be650cea753de1e69BF6BAd3c98490A855f52#code), which has the following comment:
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Utility library to calculate how many Cvx will be minted based on the amount of Crv.
 * Do not use this on-chain, as AuraMinter after can mint additional tokens after `inflationProtectionTime`
 * has passed, those new tokens are not taken into consideration in this library.
 */
```

where the discrepancy might occur because of the private `minterMinted` variable:
```solidity
// After AuraMinter.inflationProtectionTime has passed, this calculation might not be valid.
// uint256 emissionsMinted = supply - initMintAmount - minterMinted;
uint256 emissionsMinted = supply - initMintAmount;
```

However, it's being used in `outstandingRewards()`:
```solidity
// Get Aura rewards
uint256 auraRewards = manager().auraMiningLib().convertCrvToCvx(balRewards);
rewards[1] = RewardsData({rewardToken: address(aura()), outstandingRewards: auraRewards});
```

and in `rewardRate()`:
```solidity
} else if (rewardToken_ == aura) {
    // If reward token is Aura, calculate rewardRate from AuraMiningLib
    uint256 balRewardRate = auraPool.rewardRate();
    rewardRate = auraMiningLib.convertCrvToCvx(balRewardRate);
```

Furthermore, the implementation does not account for the reward multiplier set in the AURA booster. AuraRewardPool's `getReward()`'s implementation is as such:
```solidity
if (reward > 0) {
  rewards[_account] = 0;
  rewardToken.safeTransfer(_account, reward);
  IDeposit(operator).rewardClaimed(pid, _account, reward); // @audit: operator = aura booster
  emit RewardPaid(_account, reward);
}
```
which calls the `rewardClaimed` on the `operator` (AuraBooster):
```solidity
function rewardClaimed(uint256 _pid, address _address, uint256 _amount) external returns(bool){
  address rewardContract = poolInfo[_pid].crvRewards;
  require(msg.sender == rewardContract || msg.sender == lockRewards, "!auth");

  uint256 mintAmount = _amount.mul(getRewardMultipliers[msg.sender]).div(REWARD_MULTIPLIER_DENOMINATOR);

  if(mintAmount > 0) {
      //mint reward tokens
      ITokenMinter(minter).mint(_address, mintAmount);
  }
  
  return true;
}
```
Note that it is possible to change the reward multiplier of the AURA reward pool by the `feeManager` (capped at 2x the `REWARD_MULTIPLIER_DENOMINATOR`).
 
## Impact
Inaccurate `AURA` reward rate and amounts returned if:
- the reward multiplier is changed in the AURA booster
- the AURA minter mints tokens

## Recommendation
For its intent and purposes, no change is necessary IMO, but adding a `// @dev` comment to note that the potentially inaccurate AURA amounts and rate returned would be beneficial.
