# minTokenAmounts_ is useless in new configuration and doesn't provide any real slippage protection

## Summary

BLVaultLido#withdraw skims off extra stETH from the user that results from oracle arb. The problem with this is that minTokenAmounts_ no longer provides any slippage protection because it only ensures that enough is received from the liquidity pool but never enforces how much is received by the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

[BLVaultLido.sol#L224-L247](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-olympus/blob/main/sherlock-olympus/src/policies/BoostedLiquidity/BLVaultLido.sol#L224-L247)

        _exitBalancerPool(lpAmount_, minTokenAmounts_);

        // Calculate OHM and wstETH amounts received
        uint256 ohmAmountOut = ohm.balanceOf(address(this)) - ohmBefore;
        uint256 wstethAmountOut = wsteth.balanceOf(address(this)) - wstethBefore;

        // Calculate oracle expected wstETH received amount
        // getTknOhmPrice returns the amount of wstETH per 1 OHM based on the oracle price
        uint256 wstethOhmPrice = manager.getTknOhmPrice();
        uint256 expectedWstethAmountOut = (ohmAmountOut * wstethOhmPrice) / _OHM_DECIMALS;

        // Take any arbs relative to the oracle price for the Treasury and return the rest to the owner
        uint256 wstethToReturn = wstethAmountOut > expectedWstethAmountOut
            ? expectedWstethAmountOut
            : wstethAmountOut;
        if (wstethAmountOut > wstethToReturn)
            wsteth.safeTransfer(TRSRY(), wstethAmountOut - wstethToReturn);

        // Burn OHM
        ohm.increaseAllowance(MINTR(), ohmAmountOut);
        manager.burnOhmFromVault(ohmAmountOut);

        // Return wstETH to owner
        wsteth.safeTransfer(msg.sender, wstethToReturn);

minTokenAmounts_ only applies to the removal of liquidity. Since wstETH is skimmed off to the treasury the user no longer has any way to protect themselves from slippage. As shown in my other submission, oracle slop can lead to loss of funds due to this skimming.

## Impact

Users cannot protect themselves from oracle slop/wstETH skimming

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Allow the user to specify the amount of wstETH they receive AFTER the arb is skimmed.
